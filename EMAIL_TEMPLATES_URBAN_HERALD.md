Subject: The Urban Herald just called Paper Roses a 'literary masterpiece' 📰

Hi [First Name],

I have news I'm still processing.

The Urban Herald—a literary publication with 41,000 readers—just called Paper Roses "a literary masterpiece."

I've read this sentence about twenty times now, and it still doesn't feel real.

When I started writing this book, it was just me, a laptop, and a story that wouldn't let me go. A story about inheritance, identity, and the weight of family secrets that span generations.

Now, it's being recognized by one of the most respected voices in literary fiction.

If you've been on the fence about reading Paper Roses, maybe this is your sign.

And if you've already read it—thank you. Truly. Every reader, every review, every conversation about this book means the world to me.

Would you consider leaving a review on Amazon or Goodreads? It helps more readers discover Abigail's story.
