The Urban Herald—a literary publication with 41,000 readers—just called Paper Roses "a literary masterpiece."

When I started writing this book, it was just me, a laptop, and a story about family secrets that wouldn't let me go.

Now it's being recognized by one of the most respected voices in literary fiction.

To everyone who's read it, reviewed it, or shared it—thank you. This is as much yours as it is mine.

**Caption:**
```
As a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, I've spent years helping individuals and families navigate generational trauma, identity, and breaking cycles.

When I decided to explore these themes through fiction, I never imagined The Urban Herald would call the result "a literary masterpiece."

Paper Roses is my debut novel—a multi-generational family drama about inheritance (financial and emotional), identity, and what it takes to finally break the cycle.

It's been compared to The Vanishing Half and Little Fires Everywhere, and I'm honored by the response from readers and critics alike.

If you're interested in:
- Generational trauma in storytelling
- The intersection of therapy and fiction
- Family dynamics and identity
- Breaking cycles

I'd love to connect. Chapter 1 is free on my website: www.debbieshow.com
