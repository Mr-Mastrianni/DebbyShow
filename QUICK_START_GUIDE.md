The Urban Herald—a literary publication with 41,000 readers—just called Paper Roses "a literary masterpiece."

When I started writing this book, it was just me, a laptop, and a story about family secrets that wouldn't let me go.

Now it's being recognized by one of the most respected voices in literary fiction.

To everyone who's read it, reviewed it, or shared it—thank you. This is as much yours as it is mine.

- Time needed: 30 min/day

**"I'm not good at social media"**

**"The graphics look complicated"**
- Use Canva templates (search "book quote")
- Or just post book cover + text caption
- Graphics help but aren't required

**"I'm overwhelmed"**

- Do one thing at a time
- Progress > perfection
